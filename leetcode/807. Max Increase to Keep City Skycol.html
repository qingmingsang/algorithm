      807. Max Increase to Keep City Skycol
      In a 2 dimensional array grid, each value grid[i][j] represents the height of a building located there. We are
      allowed
      to increase the height of any number of buildings, by any amount (the amounts can be different for different
      buildings). Height 0 is considered to be a building as well.

      At the end, the "skycol" when viewed from all four directions of the grid, i.e. top, bottom, left, and right,
      must
      be
      the same as the skycol of the original grid. A city's skycol is the outer contour of the rectangles formed by
      all
      the buildings when viewed from a distance. See the following example.

      What is the maximum total sum that the height of the buildings can be increased?

      Example:
      Input: grid = [[3,0,8,4],[2,4,5,7],[9,2,6,3],[0,3,1,0]]
      Output: 35
      Explanation:
      The grid is:
      [ [3, 0, 8, 4],
      [2, 4, 5, 7],
      [9, 2, 6, 3],
      [0, 3, 1, 0] ]

      The skycol viewed from top or bottom is: [9, 4, 8, 7]
      The skycol viewed from left or right is: [8, 7, 9, 3]

      The grid after increasing the height of buildings without affecting skycols is:

      gridNew = [ [8, 4, 8, 7],
      [7, 4, 7, 7],
      [9, 4, 8, 7],
      [3, 3, 3, 3] ]

      Notes:

      1 < grid.length=grid[0].length <=50. All heights grid[i][j] are in the range [0, 100]. All buildings in grid[i][j]
        occupy the entire grid cell: that is, they are a 1 x 1 x grid[i][j] rectangular prism.
